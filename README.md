## Diffractive background studies

This collection of `c++` and `python 3+` programs is used to (1) study the background component in simulated (*Pythia-8*) diffractive events at ALICE and (2)
to reject the background component in the measured data.

1. In order to study the background component alice tasks are available in `./tasks/`. These tasks require an additional folder containing the *Offline Analysis DataBase* - 
an `OADB` folder - to be placed into the `./tasks/` folder.
