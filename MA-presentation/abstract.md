## Abstract

<p style="text-align: justify">  
The ALICE experiment consists of a central barrel and a forward muon spectrometer[1]. Additional smaller detectors for global event characterization and triggering are located at small angles outside of the central barrel. Such a geometry allows the investigation of many properties of diffractive reactions at hadron colliders for example the measurement of single and double diffractive dissociation cross-sections and the study of central exclusive production (CEP). Central diffractive events are defined experimentally by hits in the central barrel and no activity outside the central barrel creating an activity gap in the rapidity observable[2]. The gap condition is further reinforced by the absence of signal in small angle detectors outside the barrel.

Studying Pythia-8 simulations of these processes show a drastic reduction of non-diffractive events (background) by enforcing the rapidity gap condition. The remaining background is largely composed of partially reconstructed CEP events, so called feed down events. Often feed down events are accompanied by neutral particles which is are not detected. This missing mass and momentum leads to a shift of the invariant mass spectrum to lower masses. 
This work aims to apply machine learning methods for background suppression of CEP events. The multivariate approach is motivated by the fact that the known mathematical models decribing the depandence of the quantity of interest on the relevant measured variables are insufficient and statistical training may provide a better description of data[3].
