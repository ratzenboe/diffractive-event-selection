1. Small recap about rectangulare cuts

1. Problems with rectangular cuts    
    - By repeatedly performing cuts only in lower-dimensional subspaces of the observable space, 
    one cannot fully exploit possible dependencies between the input variables. Further, 
    a signal event might look like a background event in only one variable, which might 
    lead to misclassification using the traditional cut-based analysis approach. 
    Multivariate techniques, however, might still be able to correctly classify this event 
    since they can compensate for this background-like variable by simultaneously considering 
    all other variables which potentially look very signal-like.

1. small recap on classical *linear* (non-MVA) approaches
    - linear classifier uses a  linear function  of  its  inputs  to base its decision on.
    - Maximum likelihood

1. What MVA can do better
    - Decision tree
    - simple perceptron
    - neural network
        - how features are learned
        - how it can approximate a function (http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html)

1. Applications to ALICE CEP data
Event classification problem
    - show various feature distribution plots
    - show simple MC approach
